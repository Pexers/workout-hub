# Workout-Hub
This repository contains a full-stack web development project implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB Express React Node). Most of the project was developed during the 1st semester of my MSc Degree for the subject "Software Engineering" where the goal was to understand and describe the basic principles of systems development, with specific application to software development processes, as well as modeling methods, design, implementation and verification that support these development processes.

The web application implemented helps its users to plan physical activities by providing detailed information about any type of activities available on the platform. The administrators are responsible for submitting new activities to the community. Each user can create custom activities if they don't find the one they are looking for.

### Domain model
This model follows the principles of UML (Unified Modeling Language).
