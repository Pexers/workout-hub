# Workout-Hub
Most of this project was developed during the 1st semester of my MSc Degree for the subject "Software Engineering", where I had to come with an idea for a software project to be developed in a period of three months. The goal of this subject was to understand and describe the basic principles of systems development, software development processes, as well as modeling methods, design, implementation, and validation to support these processes.

I named it **Workout-Hub**, a full-stack web application implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB-Express-React-NodeJS) that helps its users to plan and to put into practice physical activities, by providing detailed information about any type of activity available on the platform. The administrators are responsible for submitting new activities to the community hub. Each user can create their own activity plans, but also custom activities, in case they can't find the one they are looking for.

### Domain Model

### Responsive Web Design
With the help of React-Bootstrap, it was possible to implement a responsive web design for most React components.
