# Workout-Hub üèãÔ∏è
Developed during the 1<sup>st</sup> semester of my MSc degree for the subject _Software Engineering_, where I had to come with an idea for a software project to be developed in a period of three months. The goal of this subject was to understand and describe the basic principles of systems development, software development processes, as well as modeling methods, design, implementation, and validation to support these processes.

I named it **Workout-Hub**, a full-stack web application implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB-ExpressJS-React-NodeJS) that helps its users to plan and to put into practice physical activities by providing detailed information of any type of activity available on the platform. The administrators are responsible for submitting new activities to the community hub. Each user can create their own activity plans, but also custom activities that aren't available by default.

## Domain Model
This model follows the principles of UML (Unified Modeling Language).

## Responsive Web Design
With the help of React-Bootstrap, it was possible to implement a responsive web design for most React components.
