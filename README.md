# Workout-Hub üèãÔ∏è
Developed during the 1<sup>st</sup> semester of my MSc degree for the subject _Software Engineering_, where I had to come up with an idea for a software project to be developed in a period of three months. The goal of this subject was to understand and describe the basic principles of systems development, software development processes, as well as modeling, implementation, and validation methods to support these processes.

I named it **Workout-Hub**, a full-stack web application implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB-ExpressJS-React-NodeJS) that helps its users to plan and to put into practice physical activities. 

The _administrators_ are responsible for submitting new activities to the community hub. Each user can create their own activity plans, as well as custom activities that aren't available by default on the platform.

## Responsive Web Design
With the help of [**React-Bootstrap**](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), it was possible to implement a responsive web design for most React components.
